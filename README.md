# app-digitaal-loket-ldes-feed
This application includes an instance of https://github.com/redpencilio/fragmentation-producer-service. 
This service provides where users can query LDES streams or add versioned members to a stream using HTTP.

Note: currently this application does not include a mu-identifier or mu-dispatcher as only one endpoint is exposed.
It might be desirable to change this in the future as we add more services to the application
